1.42 Modify the drawCircle function so that the circle is drawn with the

"""
1.43* The drawCircle function is somewhat inefficient: for small circles, 360
sides is really overkill and for very large circles 360 sides might be too
few.  See if you can devise a way to make the number of sides and turning
angle dependent on the radius so that smaller circles use fewer sides and
larger circles use more.
